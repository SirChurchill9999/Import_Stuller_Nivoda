The Shopify REST API uses pagination to display products. The default number of products per page is 50, but the limit can be set to 250. One must make multiple calls to the API using the link to the next page provided in the previous response.

My problem is that I cannot get my code to the point of paginating through \~1,300 products and concatenating them to a single array `allProducts`. I have attempted to define the link:

```
const headerLink = products.headers.Link[0]
```

`response.json` has the following schema, hence `headerLink`:

```
[
  {
    "data": [
      {
        "id": 8182698481811,
        "title": "product_title",
        ...........
        }
    ],
    "headers": {
      ...
      "Link": [
        "<https://{EXAMPLE}.com/admin/api/2023-04/products.json?limit=50&page_info=eyJsYXN0X2lkIjo4MTIyNDIxNzcyNTkxLCJsYXN0X3ZhbHsafwegVlIjoiMTRLIFJvc2UgNSBtbSBDdXNoaW9JKDAuIEZvmluZyIsImRpcmVsdawejdGlvbiI6Im5leHQifQ>; rel=\"next\""
      ],
      ...
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
```

However, my code seems to spit out the same link repeatedly:

```
The next link:  https://example.myshopify.com/admin/api/2023-04/products.json?limit=50&page_info=yJsYXN0X2lkIjo4MTIyNDIxNzcyNTkxLCJsYXN0X3ZhbHsafwegVlIjoiMTRLIFJvc2UgNSBtbSBDdXNoaW9JKDAuIEZvmluZyIsImRpcmVsdawejdGlvbiI6Im5leHQifQ
```

`rel=\"next\""` in my code below indicates that there's another page available. If we had reached the last page already, this line would be missing in the response.
